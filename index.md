I’m a PhD candidate in Linguistics at Stanford University, co-advised by [Dan Jurafsky](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/) and [Rob Podesva](https://stanford.edu/~podesva/). Broadly, my research bridges sociolinguistics, computational linguistics, and psycholinguistics to explore how language encodes social meaning and shapes bias in both humans and AI systems.

In my dissertation, I’m developing machine learning algorithms to detect and model how linguistic variation among Black drivers in Oakland correlates with disparities in police behavior during traffic stops, integrating raciolinguistic theory and psychological experimentation to align model outputs with human perception.

I’ve been supported by the [NSF-GRFP](https://www.pomona.edu/news/2023/05/03-eleven-pomona-college-students-and-alumni-awarded-nsf-graduate-research-fellowships) as well as Stanford’s [DARE](https://vpge.stanford.edu/fellowships-funding/dare/fellows/2025), [RAISE](https://vpge.stanford.edu/fellowships-funding/raise/fellows/2023), and [HAI-TEP](https://hai.stanford.edu/policy/student-opportunities/tech-ethics-policy-fellowships) Fellowships. Outside of Stanford, my research has included collaborations with [Google Research](https://research.google/blog/responsible-ai-at-google-research-the-impact-lab/), IBM Research, and the [Brookings Institution](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/closing-the-gap-a-call-for-more-inclusive-language-technologies/) on projects examining LLM neutrality and comparative bias in generative and embedding models, alongside policy-oriented initiatives promoting more inclusive and equitable AI and language technologies.
